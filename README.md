# Coffee Sales Analysis
Conducted an analysis of coffee sales from Jan to Jun 2023 and built a dynamic dashboard in Excel

## Background:
- John has recently become a franchise owner at Maven Roasters, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City.
- To better understand purchase behaviour and streamline operations, he has collected transactional data from Jan - Jun 2023.
- His goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for business.

## Objectives:
1) Clean and prepare the raw data for analysis.
2) Explore the data with pivot tables.
3) Build a dynamic dashboard to visualise patterns and trends.

## Insights:
- Revenue is the highest in **June** in all three locations.
### For Lower Manhattan: 
1) Highest transactions were recorded on Mondays. 
2) Transactions were the lowest from **7 - 8 pm**. Transactions were the highest from **8 -10 am**.
3) **Coffee and Tea** were the most popular product category. **Package Chocolate** was the least popular product category.
4) **Barista Espresso** was the top product based on transactions and total revenue.

### For Hell's Kitchen:
1) No particular trend/pattern for total transactions by day of week. 
2) Transactions was the lowest at **8 pm**. Transactions were the highest from **8 -10 am**.
3) **Coffee and Tea** were the most popular product category. **Branded** was the least popular product category.
4) **Barista Espresso** was the top product based on transactions and total revenue.

### For Astoria:
1) No particular trend/pattern for total transactions by day of week. 
2) Although transactions dropped from **10 am** onwards, transactions were relatively consistent from **11 to 7pm**. Transactions were the highest from **8 -10 am**.
3) **Coffee and Tea** were the most popular product category. **Packaged Chocolate** was the least popular product category.
4) **Brewed Chai Tea** was the top product based on transactions and total revenue.

## Recommendation/Next Steps:
- John can consider **shorten the cafe's business hours** in Lower Manhattan (close at 6pm instead of 8pm) since there was not much transactions from 6pm onwards. Likewise goes for his cafe in Hell's Kitchen (close at 7pm). This can help John reduce operational cost and bring him some potential savings.
- John can consider **dropping some of the products** that are not in the top 15 list since transactions were low and the revenues generated were not significant. Expenses may be worth spending on improving current popular products (Eg: Barista Expresso / Brewed Chai Tea)
- Overall, transactions tend to be the highest on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.To improve his overall cafe business, John can consider **lauching promotional campaigns** during non peak days and non peak hours to attract more customers. For example, give a 20% discount for coffee and tea bought at Tuesdays from 2 to 5pm.
